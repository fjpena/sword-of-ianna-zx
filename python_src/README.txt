This is a Python-based version we used during development, to prototype new functionality and also as a level exporter.

Requirements:
- Python 2.7
- Pygame + associated dependencies
- pytmxlib, specifically the fork at https://github.com/fjpena/pytmxlib

You can test a level export by hitting H (pause), then X. You can also export all game sprites with H (pause), then S.
